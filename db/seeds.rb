# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# Course.create(name: "Duke Meadows", par_score: 27)
# Course.create(name: "The Berkshire", par_score: 72)

# Round.create(course_id: 1, date: "26/11/1994", number_of_holes: 9, score: 52, guest_name: "Bod", guest_score: 27)
# Round.create(course_id: 1, date: "26/11/1994", number_of_holes: 9, score: 34, guest_name: "Rutland", guest_score: 100)
